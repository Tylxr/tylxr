## Hi there 👋
I'm Tyler, a Full Stack Software Developer based in Suffolk, UK.

#### Current Personal Project 🙇‍♂️
'Twitter Clone' is a narrowly scoped project I decided to start building as an excuse to design a scalable, distributed system that's over-engineered for its intended purpose. 🙃 As there are no actual requirements, the design is purposely only scalable to a point and it's tuned to work with low-medium traffic out of the box, despite having the extensibility to handle more! It's just for fun. 😊

Feel free to browse the code if you're interested.
