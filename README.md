## Hi there 👋
I'm Tyler, a fullstack software developer from Suffolk in the UK.

#### Current Personal Project 🙇‍♂️
'Twitter Clone' is a narrowly scoped project I decided to start building as an excuse to design a highly scalable, distributed system that's over-engineered for its intended purpose. 🙃
It's just for fun.

Feel free to browse the code if you're interested.
